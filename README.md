# Arduino-Communication

An Arduino Project to use light signals to communicate messages to and from other arduino boards.

Using an array of input and output modules with the arduino board a message with the input data is communicated to a different arduino script reading the data to a desired output. This is done with communicating bits though an LED and is a proof of concept for technologies such as fibre optic communication.
